# Q-learning Atari AI

(Game library) ▼

You can change the game this AI plays by going to line 74 and changing the gym.make variable to any other game in the Open-AI gym library. Here is a link to all of the games.      https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari



(Working enviroment ▼)

This should work with any up to date version of open AI Gym. However, This Bot was built and optimized for tensorflow 1.15.0 
and may not work with some builds of tensorflow 2.0. I reccomend using a docker file or virtual enviroment if you regularly use tensorflow 2.
